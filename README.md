# Process-Simulation
Simulation of unit operations on Matlab. Projects based on use of Matlab to 
1. Solve differential equations
2. Analyse and operate on probability distributions
3. Optimize code and reduce error in the results of the program
4. Visualise results 
5. Iterate based on FEM

Note:
1. The matlab codes are compilable on the web version or Matlab 2018b or higher
2. To understand the objective of each code refer to the corresponding pdf files
